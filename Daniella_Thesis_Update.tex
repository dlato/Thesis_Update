\bigskip

\textbf{Inversions + Gene Expression:}

\textbf{Final dataframes:}
Queenie has finished the final dataframes for this analysis for both the raw data (for DESeq) and normalized expression values (for other analysis).
I have been checking these to ensure that they are correct and have found some minor errors in her code.
She is fixing these and should be done by end of day Monday.
Additionally, she needed more information from the BLAST outputs on all gene names so I have written a short script to extract this information for her.
I suspect that the overall results will not change that much because the errors only impact a few genes and if they are included/excluded from the analysis.


\textbf{DESeq Analysis:}
As I mentioned to you briefly last week, I was having trouble performing DESeq because my ``matrix is not full rank''. 
This means that the combination of levels in each of my experimental design columns (treatment (inversion/non-inversion), strain, experiment) are co-linear.
This is because the strain and inversion/non-inversion combinations are similar.
For example, DESeq can not tell the difference between the ATCC strain and the inverted treatment, because it impacts the same samples (all the ATCC samples).
Therefore, DESeq can not say if the differential expression is due to the strain or the inversion.
I took your advice and tried to make my input data as simple as possible, but I am still getting this error.
The only way that I will not get this error is if I look at each column in my experimental design matrix separately. 
i.e. $\sim$ treatment, $\sim$ strain, $\sim$ experiment.
However, based on my preliminary exploration of the data, it seems as though the experiment is driving most of the differential expression (which makes sense because the raw data is coming from a number of experiments that although we tried to use control data, they still were done in different labs, at different time...etc).
\textbf{I am concerned that by doing $\sim$ treatment, and not $\sim$ treatment + experiment (which is what you usually do to combat say batch or lane effects), I am not accounting for the variation in expression between experiments. Do you have any thoughts on how I can ensure that the expression differences I am seeing with $\sim$ treatment are due to treatment along and not confounded by experiment? }
 
\textbf{Summary of Inversion and Exp Results:}
I have included all the results for this analysis (except the DESeq analysis) in Tables \ref{tab:HNS} - \ref{tab:log_reg_strain}.

I performed the H-NS analysis (looking at Pearson correlation between H-NS and Inversion/significant inversion) on each of the H-NS datasets (Table \ref{tab:HNS}).
It seems as though within the Higashi 2016 dataset, it does not seem to matter which criteria for H-NS binding I use, they all give me roughly the same answer.
This dataset also have multiple criteria for the non-coding H-NS binding so I looked at each non-coding criteria and the coding criteria 1, and again found that there appears to be no difference in the results depending on what criteria you choose.
However, when we look across datasets, Grainger 2006 and Ueda 2013 have no significant correlation between H-NS binding and the inverted/significant inversions.
For this reason, I think that the results from all the datasets need to be included in this paper/supplement.
\textbf{I am not sure if it makes sense to say that H-NS has a positive correlation between inverted sites compared to non-inverted sites if some of the datasets do not show this. Thoughts?}

In Table \ref{tab:overall_inver_exp}, there is a clear correlation between inverted blocks or individual inverted sequences and a significant difference in gene expression.
When there is a significant difference in gene expression between inverted and non-inverted sequences within a block, inverted sequences have higher expression than non-inverted sequences about 58\% of the time (Table \ref{tab:multi_taxa_inver}).
Table \ref{tab:len_summary} shows a positive correlation between block length and blocks with a significant difference in expression between inverted and non-inverted sequences.
However, I am just looking into this now and I am confused by this. I will get back to you on that.

When looking at distance from the origin of replication, we see that using all genomic positions across all strains (where inversions can be present in different genomic positions), there is no correlation between distance from the origin of replication and blocks with significant differences in gene expression between inverted and non-inverted sequences (Table \ref{tab:pos_summary}).
Table \ref{tab:log_reg} shows multiple logistic regressions on the various values for inversions and distance from the origin of replication.
This table again is considering points from all strains.
The placement of inversion (all inversions, including ones with significant and non-significant differences in gene expression) appears to be concentrated near the terminus.
When looking at only inversions with significant difference in gene expression, we see that these are located closer to the origin of replication.

Table \ref{tab:log_reg_strain} shows the logistic regression between the inversion category (for all inversions, including ones that did not have a sig difference in gene expression) and distance from the origin of replication in each strain.
The ``rev comp'' column is when that particular strain is inverted. The ``inversion'' column is when at least one strain in that block is inverted.
Only \ecol K-12 DH10B and ATCC have inverted sequences, so really the other strains values are irrelevant.
I also think the ``inversion'' column is irrelevant because it is the same data for each strain just with different genomic positions.
We can see that the ATCC strain has most of its inversions concentrated near the origin of replication and less near the terminus.
In the K-12 DH10B  there was no significant correlation with distance from the origin of replication and placement of inversions.


\textbf{Aside from the DESeq analysis, this is all the analysis that I have planned. Plus some sort of figure potentially looking at H-NS binding and inversions. Do you have anything else that you think I should look at or look more into?}


\textbf{Inversion Visualization:}
I have figured out the differences between the images I presented you with last time (where ATCC was reverse complemented or not).
Each time you run PARSNP, even if it is on the same sequences but one is reverse complemented, it (obviously) runs the entire algorithm again.
However, the output creates subtle difference in the sequences within the blocks.
So some blocks that did not have a rearrangement when ATCC was not reverse complemented, have a rearrangement when ATCC is reverse complemented.
This is why there appears to be more rearrangements between BW25113 and K-12 DH10B in Figure \ref{fig:inversion_revcomp} (ATCC reverse complemented) compared to Figure \ref{fig:inversion_norevcomp} (ATCC not reverse complemented).

I cheated a bit and did a ``manual'' reverse complement of the ATCC block locations from the original data (where ATCC is not reverse complemented) by simply reversing the genomic positions (not altering the sequence data or anything else at all).
This resulted in a much ``cleaner'' picture of the inversions (Figure \ref{fig:inversion_manual_revcomp}).
This only reverse complemented the inversions visually in ATCC and did not create new rearrangements between BW25113 and K-12 DH10B.

\textbf{The reason I wanted to ``clean up'' the inversion visualization is to combat reviewers comments. I suspect a reviewer will say ``it looks like the entire ATCC genome is inverted (in Figure \ref{fig:inversion_norevcomp}), so why didn't you fix this? Are your inversions accurate?'' I am unsure if it is ``correct'' to use the manual reverse complement cleaned version (Figure \ref{fig:inversion_manual_revcomp}) and say that ATCC was reverse complemented to simplify the diagram? But then I think maybe the inversions should also be manually reversed (so anything that was an inversion when it was not reverse complemented would now not be an inversion, and vice versa). But again, I am not sure if this is ``correct''. What do you think about all this?}

%I have been looking at programs to best depict the inversions we are seeing but most take too long to run (dot plots) or are quite complicated in the input files.
%I found a way to use parallel sets in \texttt{R} to get around this and I think they are pretty good (Figure \ref{fig:inversion_norevcomp})!
%In Figure \ref{fig:inversion_norevcomp}, it appears as though the whole ATCC genome (CP009072) is inverted.
%So I decided to reverse complement the entire genome of ATCC and then re-create the diagram to see if it would make a difference (Figure \ref{fig:inversion_revcomp}).
%Figure \ref{fig:inversion_revcomp} does clean things up a bit and still shows some of the inversions.
%Additionally, I am a bit confused because theoretically just reversing one sequence should still identify the same blocks in \texttt{PARSNP} when the sequence is not reversed.
%However, the blocks are all slightly different in their positions but the overall \texttt{PARSNP} visualization looks identical.
%So I am a bit confused about which image I should use in the paper.
%My main concern with this is if it is ok to use one image for the visualization (the reverse complemented image Figure \ref{fig:inversion_revcomp}), and the data from the other figure (non-reverse complemented Figure \ref{fig:inversion_norevcomp}) for the data analysis.
%I mention this because when ATCC is reverse complemented it complicates the genomic position annotation. So I would have to ensure that all my annotation is also reverse complemented and that I am grabbing the correct sequence (reverse of the reverse complement?) when I re-align with \texttt{MAFFT}.
%\textbf{What are your thoughts on this?}



%I also noticed from Figures \ref{fig:inversion_norevcomp} and \ref{fig:inversion_revcomp} that a lot of the inversions have been rearranged in addition to being inverted.
%I am not sure how best to account for this in my calculations.
%\textbf{Do you have any thoughts on this?}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% HOW LARGE CAN THE SLOPE GET JUNE 1 2020
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%I also did the test for looking at the substitutions slope and how large it can be.
%I did this by taking the largest non-outlier bar (weighted total substitutions/10Kbp) and set the position to 0, then making another fake point with position at the terminus and a substitutions value of 0, then computing a regression.
%The results can be found in Table \ref{tab:bigslope} and the actual slope values can be found in Table \ref{tab:cod_non_cod_log_reg}.
%The slopes still seem very small to me. \textbf{What do you think? How should I approach this accurately in the paper?}

%\end{table}



%I created a new theme for the selection and substitution graphs so that they all look relatively the same (similar margins, font size..etc).
%Last week when I was re-doing the SH-Test (to see which block trees were different from the overall tree), I realized that some of these blocks were not removed from the analysis in \ecol, \smel Chromosome and \pa.
%I spent most of this week re-running these analysis with the correct number of blocks.
%The new figures and results can be found below and in the attached Supplementary File for the paper. Nothing has changed significantly.
%\smel chromosome looks really terrible. All non-outlier points for \dn and $\omega$ are zero values. Therefore a regression is pointless and makes the selection graph look really odd.
%I started to look into this but it looks like the \smel chromosomes are just so similar that there are hardly any substitutions.
%This is particularly evident when you look at the backbone of the \p alignment (which shows similar sequences).
%When looking at the \ecoli alignement (Figure \ref{fig:ecoli_mauve}) we see that the backbone is very ``spiky'' indicating regions where the nucleotides are not similar.
%The same can be said for the \strep genomes (Figure \ref{fig:strep_mauve}), even though these are more similar to each other than the \ecoli genomes. 
%When we look at the \smel Chromosome alignment (Figure \ref{fig:sinoC_mauve}), we see that the backbone is almost completely flat, meaning that there is hardly any variation in the nucleotide sequence.
%This is especially curious because there appears to be no different in the average number of substitutions in the \smel chromosome (Table \ref{tab:avg_subs}).
%It could be that all the variation is being considered an ``outlier'' because most of the values are zero (because they are so smilar)?
%I am still really confused about why the selection graph for \smel Chromosome looks so odd and the only explanation I can come up with is that the sequences are just really really similar. \textbf{Do you have any thoughts on this or suggestions for other things I could investigate to figure out what is going on?}
