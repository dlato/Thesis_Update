\section*{Last Week}

$\checkmark$ Make check lists for each of the 3 papers

$\checkmark$ Read paper on detecting selection in bacterial genomes

$\checkmark$ \# of coding and non-coding sites

$\checkmark$ \# of subs in coding and non-coding sites

$\checkmark$ look for more GEO expression data for \smel

You can see that majority of the substitutions are coming from the non-coding regions of the genomes.
And that the number of substitutions are higher in the non-coding regions than the coding regions for every replicon except \pb, which is really weird and interesting. Thoughts?



Last week was spent analyzing the coding and non-coding data. The results are summarized in the tables below.
They are exciting! 
For the chromosomes of all the bacteria (so far) it looks like the coding sections have a positive trend and the non-coding sections have a negative trend! Which makes sense biologically!
\ecoli looked like the code was doing something weird and I think it may have to do with my origin and bidirectionality scaling. I am looking into this.
It appears to be only \pa and \pb that do not follow these trends but they are not chromosomes so I think we can still make a convincing argument as to why they are not following the trends of the other replicons.
I think that maybe why we were seeing only negative trends before was because there were more substitutions in the non-coding regions than coding and these non-coding subs were driving the logistic regression to be negative.

I have been sticking to my goal of reading one paper a week during my off time while TA-ing.

%I realized that for \pb I miscalculated the bidirectionality transformation, so I had to fix this and re-run everything.
%It did not change the logistic regression results (seen below).
%However, when I re-did the origin shuffling to see if the placement of the origin changed anything, moving the origin 100kb, 90kb and 80kb to the left made the logistic regression negative (opposite). I have been trying to figure out why this is happening but I am having no luck. I thought maybe it was because these shufflings are now ~700kb away from the terminus, but the actual origin is about the same distance. I am still trying to figure this out but I am not sure what to do or what it means about the robustness of the origin shuffling.

%I looked at the gene expression data for \smel in detail and it appears to look ok.
%When I graph the raw data and plot the regression line it looks like there is no trend for \smel, the points are evenly distributed throughout the genome and there appears to be no increasing or decreasing trend.
%When looking at the other bacteria's raw data, there is clearly a decreasing trend when moving away from the origin.
%Additionally the number of genes and number of replicates are all comparable between \smel and the other bacteria.
%So I think that the reason \smel does not have significant gene expression regressions is because there is simply no trend.

%Last week I was reading an average of 2 articles a day (and will continue to do so until Aug 15). 
%While reading these papers I was researching the increased number of substitutions found near the origin of mitochondria.
%The papers I found on this subject are slightly misleading. The titles suggest that the substitution rate near the Control Region (CR) of mitochondria (which spans the origin on either side) is higher.
%However, after reading the articles I found that the substitution rate is higher than what was previously estimated using phylogenetic methods.
%So, I need to do a bit more research to see if I can find what the substitution rate for the rest of the mt genome is and see if the CR actually is higher.

\section*{This Week}
Finish up the \strep non-coding analysis.
Put numbers to the proportion of each genome that is coding/non-coding and how many substitutions are in each so I know if it truly was more substitutions in the non-coding regions that were driving the previous whole genome substitution trends.
I need to keep looking at coding \ecol and double checking it is doing what it is supposed to be doing.

I would like to make 3 check-lists for the 3 papers that we talked about today, so that I can start getting things done for them.

%In between having this finished I would like to keep looking for gene expression data for \ecoli and have this finished by the end of the week.

\section*{Next Week}

I will have a more solid list of tasks for next week based on the lists I will be making this week for the papers. So I will be starting these this week/next week.
